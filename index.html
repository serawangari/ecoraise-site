            <h2>About Leafscapes</h2>
            <p>
                Through our program, companies channel their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments into tangible environmental action by sponsoring tree planting projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The heart of Leafscapes lies in schools and their nurseries — vibrant hubs where young minds grow alongside the seedlings they nurture. Corporates partner with these schools to source healthy, locally adapted tree seedlings, directly supporting education, environmental stewardship, and local livelihoods.
            </p>
            <p>
                From urban centers to rural landscapes, Leafscapes brings together:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Corporate partners seeking impactful, measurable CSR outcomes.</li>
                <li>Schools acting as both environmental educators and seedling suppliers.</li>
                <li>Community members and volunteers who take part in planting, care, and long-term monitoring of the trees.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With Leafscapes, planting a tree becomes more than just an act of conservation — it becomes a story of collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and hope for greener, healthier futures across Kenya.
